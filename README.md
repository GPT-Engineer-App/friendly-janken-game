# friendly-janken-game

A simple rock-paper-scissors („Åò„ÇÉ„Çì„Åë„Çì) game app with a user-friendly interface. The app allows users to play the classic rock-paper-scissors game against a computer. The interface should include three buttons for the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors, and an area to display the user's choice, the computer's choice, and the result of the game (win, lose, or draw). The design should be minimalistic with a focus on ease of use. Ideal colors could be soothing shades like light blue or green, and the font should be clear and readable. Since this is a basic game, no backend functionality is needed, so the focus will be on the frontend user experience.
